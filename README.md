## 10 Days of JavaScript

### Problems Solved
* Solve "Second Largest Number" problem using array + for-loop (arrays.js)
* Reverse string (error-handling.js)
* Sock merchant -> search array for pairs (sock-merchant.js)
* Counting valleys -> array + for-loop (counting-valleys.js)

#### Hello World
* Use ```console.log();``` to print out strings/variables etc.

#### Data Types
* Converting from a string to an int: ```parseInt(string);```
* Converting from a string to a float: ```parseFloat(string);```

#### Arithmetic Operators
* There are 3 types of operators:
  * Unary: ```a++```
  * Binary: ```a + b = c```
  * Ternary: ```a ? b: c``` (this is a conditional operator)

#### Functions
* Recursion: this is an extremely important algorithmic concept that involves splitting a problem into two parts: a BASE CASE and a RECURSIVE CASE
* The problem is divided into smaller subproblems which are then solved recursively until such time as they are small enough and meet some base case; once the base case is met, the solutions for each subproblem are combined and their result is the answer to the entire problem.
* If the base case is not met, the function's recursive case calls the function again with modified values. The code must be structured in such a way that the base case is reachable after some number of iterations.

Writing a function that returns n! (n factorial)
* 3! = 3 * 2 * 1
* Needs to be written with a RECURSIVE solution (see functions.js)

#### Let and Const
* var: scope is within the context wherever it was declared
  * global: if declared outside any function
  * local: if declared within a function
* let: scope is limited to the block/statement/expression in which it is used
* const: creates a read-only reference to a value; value cannot be re-assigned

#### Conditional Statements: IF-ELSE
* Equality (==) will convert the operands if they are not of the same type
  * Same for Inequality (!=)
* Strict Equality (===) requires operands to be of the same type
  * Same for Strict Inequality (!==)
* Ternary operators: ```a ? b: c```
  * This is a shortcut for the 'if' statement -> "?" means "then"; ":" means "else"
  * If 'a' is true 'b' will be executed, otherwise 'c' will be executed

#### Conditional Statements: SWITCH
* A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression by attempting to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is found, the program jumps to the statement(s) associated with the matched label and continues executing at that point
  * The program first looks for a case clause with a label matching the value of "expression", then executes the associated statements.
  * If no matching label is found, the program looks for the optional default clause
  * If no default clause is found, the program continues executing after the end of the switch statement.
    * The DEFAULT clause, by convention, is always listed last
* A switch statement looks like this:
  ```
  switch (expression) {
    case label1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case label2:
        statement2;
        break;
    default:
        statement;
  }
  ```
* The BREAK statement ensures that the program breaks out of the switch statement once the statements associated with a matched case are executed
  * If the break statement is omitted, the program continues executing the next statement in the switch statement â€” even if its case label doesn't match "expression"

* A switch statement can have multiple criteria for each case:
  ```
  switch (n) {
      case 2:
      case 4:
      case 6:
          console.log("A");
          break;
      case 3:
      case 5:
      case 7:
          console.log("B");
          break;
      default:
          console.log("C");
  }
  ```

#### String Basics
* ```string.length(str)``` denotes the number of characters in the string
* ```String(n)``` will create a new string (where 'n' is the value we want to turn into a string)
* ```string.charAt(i)``` will return the character at a specified index
* ```string1.concat(string2)``` will return a new string consisting of the calling string "string1" and the string which was passed as an argument "string2"
* ```string.includes(c)``` returns a boolean denoting whether a string passed as an argument exists within the calling string
* ```string.endsWith(c)``` returns a boolean denoting whether the calling string ends with the characters of the string passed as an argument
* ```string.indexOf(c)``` returns an integer denoting the index within the calling string of the FIRST occurrence of a given argument  
  * If the argument isn't found in the string/no argument was passed to the function -> returns "-1"
  * If an int was passed as a second argument, it will start searching the string from the index denoted by the integer: e.g. ```string.indexOf("c", 6)```
* ```string.lastIndexOf(c)``` returns an integer denoting the index within the calling string of the LAST occurrence of a given argument
* ```string.match(RegExp)``` is used to match a regular expression passed as an argument against the calling string
  * If a match is found, it returns an object with 3 properties: the matched substring, the index it was found at, and the input (i.e. the initial string)
  * If no match is found, it returns null
  * E.g. ```string.match("[a-z]+")```
* ```string.normalize(arg)``` returns a string containing the Unicode Normalization Form of the calling string's value
  * The argument must be one of the following: NFC/NFD/NKFC/NFKD
* ```string.repeat(int)``` returns a string consisting of the elements of the calling string object repeated some number of times (given as an integer argument)
  * If no argument/0 argument is given, it returns an empty string
* ```string.replace("a", "b")``` finds a match between a regular expression and a string, then returns a string where the first matched substring is replaced with a new substring
  * If no match is found, the returned string is the same as the original string
* ```string.search(str)``` executes the search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string, then returns the index of the first character of the first match
* ```string.slice(i, j)``` extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string
  * If no arguments are passed the string, it returns the entire string
  * If one integer argument "i" is passed to the function, it returns a substring starting at index "i" and ending at the end of the string
  * If two integer arguments "i" & "j" are passed to the function, it returns a substring starting at index "i" and ending at "j - 1"
* ```string.split(arg)``` splits a string object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings
  * If no argument is given, it returns an array containing the original string
  * If an empty string "" is passed as an argument, it returns an array of the string's individual letters
  * If a string consisting of 1+ letters is passed as an argument, it splits the string at each occurence of that string, and returns an array of the split substrings
    * e.g. ```string.split(" ")``` will split words into separate arrays
* ```string.startsWith(char)``` returns a boolean denoting whether a string begins with the characters of another string passed as an argument
* ```string.substr(arg)``` SEE STRING.SLICE()
* ```string.substring(arg)``` SEE STRING.SLICE()
* ```string.toLowerCase()``` converts string to lowercase
* ```string.toUpperCase()``` converts string to uppercase
* ```string.trim()``` returns the string with the white space trimmed from its beginning and end
* ```string.trimLeft()``` returns the string with the white space trimmed from its left side
* ```string.trimRight()``` returns the string with the white space trimmed from its right side

#### Loops
* For: ```for(initialization; condition; finalExpression) { statements; }```
* While ```while(condition) { statements; }```
  * This executes the loop as long as the specified condition evaluates to TRUE
  * The condition is evaluated before executing the statement
* Do-While ```do { statements; } while (condition);```
  * This executes the loop until the specified condition evaluates to FALSE
  * The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, so the statement will always be executed at least once
* For-In ```for (var variable in object) { console.log(variable + "=" + object[variable]); }```
  * This iterates over each enumerable property (in this case named "variable") in an OBJECT, allowing statements to be executed for each distinct propety
* For-Of ```for (let variable of iterable) { statements }```
  * This iterates over iterable objects such as an Array/Map/Set/String/TypedArray/arguments object
  * It essential iterates over the VALUE of each distinct property in the structure, such as each letter in a word, or each element in an array

#### Arrays
* Create an array: ```var a = ['first', 'second'];```
* Access first item in an array: ```a[0];```
* Access last item in an array: ```a[a.length -1]```
* Loop over an array: ```a.forEach(function(element, index, array) {...})```
* Append to the end of an array: ```a.push('third');```
* Remove from the end of an array: ```let removed = a.shift();   console.log(removed);```
* Add to the front of an array: ```a.unshift('zero');```
* Find the index of an item in an array: ```a.indexOf('second');```
* Remove an item by index position: ```a.splice(index, numberToRemove);```
* Copy an array: ```let b = array.slice();```
* Sort an array: ```a.sort();``` -> this sorts in ascending order
  * Sort in descending order using a compare function: ```a.sort(function(x,y) { return x < y; });```
  * Sort in descending order using a compare arrow function: ```a.sort((x,y) => x < y);```
* Iterate over an array: ```for (let element of a) { console.log(element); }```

#### Try, Catch, and Finally (Error Handling)
* SYNTAX ERROR (parsing error)
  * Because JS is an interpreted language, this type of error occurs when the code is interpreted -> i.e. at compile time
  * When a syntax error occurs, only the code contained within the same THREAD as the syntax error is affected; independent code running in other threads will still be executed
  * Example: ```console.log("Hello"``` -> note ')' has been forgotten
* RUNTIME ERROR (exception)
  * This type of error occurs during execution (i.e. after compilation/interpretation)
  * Once a runtime error is encountered, an exception is THROWN in the hope that it will be CAUGHT by a subsequent section of code containing instructions on how to recover from the error
  * Much like syntax errors, these affect the threat in which they occurred, but allow other independent threads to continue normal execution
  * Example: ```function sum(a, b) {}    add(2,3)``` -> note 'add' is not defined
* LOGICAL ERROR
  * These are some of the most difficult errors to isolate because they cause the program to operate without terminating or crashing, but the operations they perform are not correct

##### TRY, CATCH and FINALLY
* The TRY block is the first step in error handling and is used for any block of code that is likely to raise an exception. It should contain 1+ statements to be executed, and is typically followed by at least one CATCH CLAUSE and/or the optional FINALLY CLAUSE.
* It has three forms:
  * TRY-CATCH: the 'catch' block immediately follows the 'try' block, and is only executed if an exception is thrown when executing code within the 'try block'
    * It contains statements specifying how to proceed and recover from the thrown exception
    * If no exception is thrown when executing the try block, the catch block is skipped
    * If any statement within the try block (including a function call to code outside of the block) throws an exception, control immediately shifts to the catch clause.
  * TRY-FINALLY
    * The finally block is optional. It executes after the try and catch blocks, but before any subsequent statements following these blocks
    * The finally block always executes, regardless of whether or not an exception was thrown or caught
  * TRY-CATCH-FINALLY
* An example:
  ```
  try {
      console.log(getElement(arr, 4));
  }
  catch (err) {
      console.log(err.message); // this will print out the error message
  }
  ```

##### Throw
* The THROW statement can be used to throw an exception. This can be done in two ways:
* throw value
  * Can throw an exception by following the keyword "throw" with some "value" that we wish to use for the exception being thrown
  * ```throw false;```
* throw new Error(customError)
  * Can throw the exception by following the keyword "throw" with "new Error(customError)", where "customError" is the value we want to use for the "message" property of the exception being thrown
  * ```throw new Error("boo error");```

#### JavaScript Objects
* Object: a collection of properties
* Property: an association between a 'name' (key) and a 'value'
  * We can access the property in multiple ways:
    * Dot notation: ```objectName.propertyName```
    * Bracket notation: ```objectName["propertyName"];```
* Adding a new property to an existing object: ```object.key3 = value3;```

#####Creating an object
* Using an Object Initialiser: this is a comma-separated list of 0+ property name-value pairs defining an object, enclosed in curly braces {}
  * new Object():
    ```
    var o = new Object();
    o.name1 = value1;
    o.name2 = value2;
    ```
  * Object.create()
    ```
    var x = {name1: value1, name2: value2};
    var o = Object.create(x);   // create a new object, based off 'x'
    o.name1 = newValue1;   // thiw will change the value of 'name1'
    ```
  * Initialiser notation: ```var o = {name1: value1, name2:value2}```
    * Creating object then adding properties using DOT notation:
      ```
      var o = {};
      o.name1 = value1;
      o.name2 = value2;
      ```
* Using a Constructor Function: creates an object in two steps
  * 1: Define the object type by writing a constructor function. The convention here is for the function's name to be in UpperCamelCase
    ```
    function Actor(firstName, lastName) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    ```
  * 2: Use the new operator to create a new instance of the object
    ```
    var actor1 = new Actor('Julia', 'Roberts');
    ```
