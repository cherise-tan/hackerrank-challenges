A collection of hackerrank challenges and their solutions

## 10 Days of JavaScript

### Problems Solved
* Solve "Second Largest Number" problem using array + for-loop (arrays.js)
* Reverse string (error-handling.js)
* Sock merchant -> search array for pairs (sock-merchant.js)
* Counting valleys -> array + for-loop (counting-valleys.js)

#### Hello World
* Use ```console.log();``` to print out strings/variables etc.

#### Data Types
* Converting from a string to an int: ```parseInt(string);```
* Converting from a string to a float: ```parseFloat(string);```

#### Arithmetic Operators
* There are 3 types of operators:
  * Unary: ```a++```
  * Binary: ```a + b = c```
  * Ternary: ```a ? b: c``` (this is a conditional operator)

#### Functions
* Recursion: this is an extremely important algorithmic concept that involves splitting a problem into two parts: a BASE CASE and a RECURSIVE CASE
* The problem is divided into smaller subproblems which are then solved recursively until such time as they are small enough and meet some base case; once the base case is met, the solutions for each subproblem are combined and their result is the answer to the entire problem.
* If the base case is not met, the function's recursive case calls the function again with modified values. The code must be structured in such a way that the base case is reachable after some number of iterations.

Writing a function that returns n! (n factorial)
* 3! = 3 * 2 * 1
* Needs to be written with a RECURSIVE solution (see functions.js)

#### Let and Const
* var: scope is within the context wherever it was declared
  * global: if declared outside any function
  * local: if declared within a function
* let: scope is limited to the block/statement/expression in which it is used
* const: creates a read-only reference to a value; value cannot be re-assigned

#### Conditional Statements: IF-ELSE
* Equality (==) will convert the operands if they are not of the same type
  * Same for Inequality (!=)
* Strict Equality (===) requires operands to be of the same type
  * Same for Strict Inequality (!==)
* Ternary operators: ```a ? b: c```
  * This is a shortcut for the 'if' statement -> "?" means "then"; ":" means "else"
  * If 'a' is true 'b' will be executed, otherwise 'c' will be executed

#### Conditional Statements: SWITCH
* A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression by attempting to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is found, the program jumps to the statement(s) associated with the matched label and continues executing at that point
  * The program first looks for a case clause with a label matching the value of "expression", then executes the associated statements.
  * If no matching label is found, the program looks for the optional default clause
  * If no default clause is found, the program continues executing after the end of the switch statement.
    * The DEFAULT clause, by convention, is always listed last
* A switch statement looks like this:
  ```
  switch (expression) {
    case label1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case label2:
        statement2;
        break;
    default:
        statement;
  }
  ```
* The BREAK statement ensures that the program breaks out of the switch statement once the statements associated with a matched case are executed
  * If the break statement is omitted, the program continues executing the next statement in the switch statement â€” even if its case label doesn't match "expression"

* A switch statement can have multiple criteria for each case:
  ```
  switch (n) {
      case 2:
      case 4:
      case 6:
          console.log("A");
          break;
      case 3:
      case 5:
      case 7:
          console.log("B");
          break;
      default:
          console.log("C");
  }
  ```

#### String Basics
* ```string.length(str)``` denotes the number of characters in the string
* ```String(n)``` will create a new string (where 'n' is the value we want to turn into a string)
* ```string.charAt(i)``` will return the character at a specified index
* ```string1.concat(string2)``` will return a new string consisting of the calling string "string1" and the string which was passed as an argument "string2"
* ```string.includes(c)``` returns a boolean denoting whether a string passed as an argument exists within the calling string
* ```string.endsWith(c)``` returns a boolean denoting whether the calling string ends with the characters of the string passed as an argument
* ```string.indexOf(c)``` returns an integer denoting the index within the calling string of the FIRST occurrence of a given argument  
  * If the argument isn't found in the string/no argument was passed to the function -> returns "-1"
  * If an int was passed as a second argument, it will start searching the string from the index denoted by the integer: e.g. ```string.indexOf("c", 6)```
* ```string.lastIndexOf(c)``` returns an integer denoting the index within the calling string of the LAST occurrence of a given argument
* ```string.match(RegExp)``` is used to match a regular expression passed as an argument against the calling string
  * If a match is found, it returns an object with 3 properties: the matched substring, the index it was found at, and the input (i.e. the initial string)
  * If no match is found, it returns null
  * E.g. ```string.match("[a-z]+")```
* ```string.normalize(arg)``` returns a string containing the Unicode Normalization Form of the calling string's value
  * The argument must be one of the following: NFC/NFD/NKFC/NFKD
* ```string.repeat(int)``` returns a string consisting of the elements of the calling string object repeated some number of times (given as an integer argument)
  * If no argument/0 argument is given, it returns an empty string
* ```string.replace("a", "b")``` finds a match between a regular expression and a string, then returns a string where the first matched substring is replaced with a new substring
  * If no match is found, the returned string is the same as the original string
* ```string.search(str)``` executes the search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string, then returns the index of the first character of the first match
* ```string.slice(i, j)``` extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string
  * If no arguments are passed the string, it returns the entire string
  * If one integer argument "i" is passed to the function, it returns a substring starting at index "i" and ending at the end of the string
  * If two integer arguments "i" & "j" are passed to the function, it returns a substring starting at index "i" and ending at "j - 1"
* ```string.split(arg)``` splits a string object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings
  * If no argument is given, it returns an array containing the original string
  * If an empty string "" is passed as an argument, it returns an array of the string's individual letters
  * If a string consisting of 1+ letters is passed as an argument, it splits the string at each occurence of that string, and returns an array of the split substrings
    * e.g. ```string.split(" ")``` will split words into separate arrays
* ```string.startsWith(char)``` returns a boolean denoting whether a string begins with the characters of another string passed as an argument
* ```string.substr(arg)``` SEE STRING.SLICE()
* ```string.substring(arg)``` SEE STRING.SLICE()
* ```string.toLowerCase()``` converts string to lowercase
* ```string.toUpperCase()``` converts string to uppercase
* ```string.trim()``` returns the string with the white space trimmed from its beginning and end
* ```string.trimLeft()``` returns the string with the white space trimmed from its left side
* ```string.trimRight()``` returns the string with the white space trimmed from its right side

#### Loops
* For: ```for(initialization; condition; finalExpression) { statements; }```
* While ```while(condition) { statements; }```
  * This executes the loop as long as the specified condition evaluates to TRUE
  * The condition is evaluated before executing the statement
* Do-While ```do { statements; } while (condition);```
  * This executes the loop until the specified condition evaluates to FALSE
  * The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, so the statement will always be executed at least once
* For-In ```for (var variable in object) { console.log(variable + "=" + object[variable]); }```
  * This iterates over each enumerable property (in this case named "variable") in an OBJECT, allowing statements to be executed for each distinct propety
* For-Of ```for (let variable of iterable) { statements }```
  * This iterates over iterable objects such as an Array/Map/Set/String/TypedArray/arguments object
  * It essential iterates over the VALUE of each distinct property in the structure, such as each letter in a word, or each element in an array

#### Arrays
* Create an array: ```var a = ['first', 'second'];```
* Access first item in an array: ```a[0];```
* Access last item in an array: ```a[a.length -1]```
* Loop over an array: ```a.forEach(function(element, index, array) {...})```
* Append to the end of an array: ```a.push('third');```
* Remove from the end of an array: ```let removed = a.shift();   console.log(removed);```
* Add to the front of an array: ```a.unshift('zero');```
* Find the index of an item in an array: ```a.indexOf('second');```
* Remove an item by index position: ```a.splice(index, numberToRemove);```
* Copy an array: ```let b = array.slice();```
* Sort an array: ```a.sort();``` -> this sorts in ascending order
  * Sort in descending order using a compare function: ```a.sort(function(x,y) { return x < y; });```
  * Sort in descending order using a compare arrow function: ```a.sort((x,y) => x < y);```
* Iterate over an array: ```for (let element of a) { console.log(element); }```

#### Try, Catch, and Finally (Error Handling)
* SYNTAX ERROR (parsing error)
  * Because JS is an interpreted language, this type of error occurs when the code is interpreted -> i.e. at compile time
  * When a syntax error occurs, only the code contained within the same THREAD as the syntax error is affected; independent code running in other threads will still be executed
  * Example: ```console.log("Hello"``` -> note ')' has been forgotten
* RUNTIME ERROR (exception)
  * This type of error occurs during execution (i.e. after compilation/interpretation)
  * Once a runtime error is encountered, an exception is THROWN in the hope that it will be CAUGHT by a subsequent section of code containing instructions on how to recover from the error
  * Much like syntax errors, these affect the threat in which they occurred, but allow other independent threads to continue normal execution
  * Example: ```function sum(a, b) {}    add(2,3)``` -> note 'add' is not defined
* LOGICAL ERROR
  * These are some of the most difficult errors to isolate because they cause the program to operate without terminating or crashing, but the operations they perform are not correct

##### TRY, CATCH and FINALLY
* The TRY block is the first step in error handling and is used for any block of code that is likely to raise an exception. It should contain 1+ statements to be executed, and is typically followed by at least one CATCH CLAUSE and/or the optional FINALLY CLAUSE.
* It has three forms:
  * TRY-CATCH: the 'catch' block immediately follows the 'try' block, and is only executed if an exception is thrown when executing code within the 'try block'
    * It contains statements specifying how to proceed and recover from the thrown exception
    * If no exception is thrown when executing the try block, the catch block is skipped
    * If any statement within the try block (including a function call to code outside of the block) throws an exception, control immediately shifts to the catch clause.
  * TRY-FINALLY
    * The finally block is optional. It executes after the try and catch blocks, but before any subsequent statements following these blocks
    * The finally block always executes, regardless of whether or not an exception was thrown or caught
  * TRY-CATCH-FINALLY
* An example:
  ```
  try {
      console.log(getElement(arr, 4));
  }
  catch (err) {
      console.log(err.message); // this will print out the error message
  }
  ```

##### Throw
* The THROW statement can be used to throw an exception. This can be done in two ways:
* throw value
  * Can throw an exception by following the keyword "throw" with some "value" that we wish to use for the exception being thrown
  * ```throw false;```
* throw new Error(customError)
  * Can throw the exception by following the keyword "throw" with "new Error(customError)", where "customError" is the value we want to use for the "message" property of the exception being thrown
  * ```throw new Error("boo error");```

#### JavaScript Objects
* Object: a collection of properties
* Property: an association between a 'name' (key) and a 'value'
  * We can access the property in multiple ways:
    * Dot notation: ```objectName.propertyName```
    * Bracket notation: ```objectName["propertyName"];```
* Adding a new property to an existing object: ```object.key3 = value3;```

#####Creating an object
* Using an Object Initialiser: this is a comma-separated list of 0+ property name-value pairs defining an object, enclosed in curly braces {}
  * new Object():
    ```
    var o = new Object();
    o.name1 = value1;
    o.name2 = value2;
    ```
  * Object.create()
    ```
    var x = {name1: value1, name2: value2};
    var o = Object.create(x);   // create a new object, based off 'x'
    o.name1 = newValue1;   // thiw will change the value of 'name1'
    ```
  * Initialiser notation: ```var o = {name1: value1, name2:value2}```
    * Creating object then adding properties using DOT notation:
      ```
      var o = {};
      o.name1 = value1;
      o.name2 = value2;
      ```
* Using a Constructor Function: creates an object in two steps
  * 1: Define the object type by writing a constructor function. The convention here is for the function's name to be in UpperCamelCase
    ```
    function Actor(firstName, lastName) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    ```
  * 2: Use the new operator to create a new instance of the object
    ```
    var actor1 = new Actor('Julia', 'Roberts');
    ```
#### Classes

##### Functional Classes
* Using Functions:
  * 1: Define a normal JavaScript function
  * 2: Create an object using the "new" keyword
  * 3: Define properties and methods for a created object using the "this" keyword
    ```
    function Fruit (type) {
      this.type = type;
      this.color = 'unknown';
      this.getInformation = getFruitInformation;
    }

    function getFruitInformation() {
      return 'This ' + this.type + ' is ' + this.color + '.';
    }

    let lime = new Fruit('Mexican lime');
    lime.color = 'green';
    ```
    * NB the function 'getFruitInformation' can be defined internally (i.e. inside the 'Fruit' constructor function)
* The Prototype Property
  * The drawback of internally defining the "getInformation" function is that it recreates that function every time we create a new Fruit object
  * Fortunately, every function in JavaScript has something called a prototype property, which is empty by default
  * We can think of a function's prototype as an object blueprint; when we add methods and properties to the prototype, they are accessible to all instances of that function
  * This is especially useful for inheritance
  * Can add a function to our Constructor Function's Prototype like so:
    ```
    function Fruit (type) {
      this.type = type;
      this.color = 'unknown';
    }

    Fruit.prototype.getInformation = function() {
      return 'This ' + this.type + ' is ' + this.color + '.';
    }

    let lime = new Fruit('Mexican lime');
    lime.color = 'green';
    ```
* Using Object Literals
  * We can use object literals to define an object's properties and functions by initializing a variable with a comma-separated list of property-value pairs enclosed in curly braces
    ```
    let lime = {
      type: 'Mexican lime',
      color: 'green'
    }
    ```
* Singleton Class Using a Function
  * A SINGLETON class is a design pattern that restricts a class to a SINGLE instance
  * When we assign the value of ```new function() {...}``` to a variable, the following happens:
    * We define an anonymous constructor function
    * We invoke the anonymous constructor function with the "new" keyword
    ```
    let lime = new function() {
      this.type = 'Mexican lime';
      this.color = 'green';
      };
    }
    ```

##### Classes
* JavaScript classes are a means of more simply and clearly creating objects and dealing with inheritance
* Classes are defined in two ways:
  * CLASS DECLARATIONS: to declare a class, we use the "class" keyword and follow it with the class' name
    * Ideally we always write classes in TitleCase
    ```
    class Polygon {
      constructor(height, width){
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
      }
    }

    let p = new Polygon(1, 2);
    ```
    * An important distinction between FUNCTION declarations and CLASS declarations is that function declarations are hoisted (i.e. can be referenced before they're declared), but class declarations are not
    * This means we MUST first declare our class before attempting to access/reference it
  * CLASS EXPRESSIONS: these can also be used to define a class, and can be named or unnamed
    * The name given to a named class expression is local to the class' body
    * UNNAMED CLASS:
      ```
      let Polygon = class{
        constructor(height, width){
          this.height = height;
          this.width = width;
        }
      }

      let p = new Polygon(1, 2);
      ```
    * NAMED CLASS: ```let Polygon = class Polygon{...}```

##### The Constuctor Method
* This is a special method we use to create and initialise objects of a class
* A class can only have ONE special method with the name "constructor"; attempting to write a class containing >1 constructor will throw an error
* To implement INHERITANCE, we can use the "super" keyword in a constructor to call a parent class constructor

##### Prototype Methods
```
class Polygon {
    constructor(height, width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }
    getArea() {
        return this.height * this.width;
    }
}

const square = new Polygon(10, 10);
```

##### Static Methods
* Static methods are methods relevant to all instances of a class â€” not just any one instance
* These methods receive information from their arguments and not a class instance, which allows us to invoke a class' static methods without creating an instance of the class
* In fact, we actually can't call a static method on an instantiated class object (attempting to do so throws a TypeError).
* We define a class' static methods using the "static" keyword
* We typically use these methods to create utility functions for applications, as they can't be called on class objects.
```
class Point {
    constructor(x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    static distance(a, b) {
        const dx = a.x - b.x;
        const dy = a.y - b.y;
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
}

const p1 = new Point(5, 5);
const p2 = new Point(10, 10);

// The correct way to call a static method
console.log(Point.distance(p1, p2));

// Attempt to call a static method on an instance of the class will fail
console.log(p1.distance(p1, p2));
```

##### Inheritance
* In essence, this construct allows us to create an object prototype or class that's an extension of another object prototype or class
* A class inheriting from some other class (referred to as a superclass or parent class) is called a subclass (or child class)
* The subclass inherits the superclass' methods and behaviors, but it can also declare new ones or even override existing ones

##### Subclassing with the "extends" keyword
* We use the "extends" keyword in class declarations or class expressions to create a child class (i.e., subclass)
```
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(this.name, 'speaks.');
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(this.name, 'barks.');
    }
}
```
* We can also "extend" functional classes
```
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
    console.log(this.name, 'speaks.');
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(this.name, 'barks.');
    }
}

let spot = new Dog('Spot');
spot.speak();
```

##### Superclass Calls using the "super" Keyword
* We use the "super" keyword to call functions on an object's parent
```
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(this.name, 'speaks.');
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        super.speak();
        console.log(this.name, 'barks.');
    }
}

let spot = new Dog('Spot');
spot.speak();
```

##### Extending an Object
* The ability to extend multiple classes from the same superclass (or model multiple object types after the same prototype) is powerful because it provides us with certain implied guarantees about the basic functionality of the subclasses; as extensions of the parent class, subclasses are guaranteed to (at minimum) have the superclass' fields, methods, and functions.
